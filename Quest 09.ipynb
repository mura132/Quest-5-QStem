    "To perform a hypothesis test for a biased coin, you can use a binomial test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that the coin is unbiased (p=0.5), and the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the coin is biased (\n",
    "p≠0.5). You can then use the binomial probability formula to calculate the probability of obtaining 55 or more heads in 100 flips under the assumption that the coin is unbiased. If this probability (p-value) is very low, you may reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative.\n",

    "To test the hypothesis that the average weight of a population is different from 150 lbs, you can use a two-sample t-test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that the average weight is equal to 150 lbs (=μ=150), and the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the average weight is different from 150 lbs (μ≠150). Use the sample mean, sample standard deviation, and sample size to calculate the t-statistic and find the corresponding p-value.\n",

    "A Type II error occurs when you fail to reject a false null hypothesis. It is also known as a false negative or beta error. The probability of making a Type II error is denoted by (β). The power of a test is 1−β, and it represents the probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis. Type I and Type II errors are inversely related, and minimizing one increases the other."

    "Power in Hypothesis Testing:\n",
    "Power is the probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis. It is influenced by factors such as effect size, significance level (α), and sample size.\n",
    "A larger sample size generally leads to higher power, increasing the ability to detect a true effect.\n",
